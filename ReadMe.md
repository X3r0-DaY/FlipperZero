======| PAYLOAD DESCRIPTIONS |======

WIN10-NC-Rev-Shell
Creates a reverse shell back to the attacker


Resources downloaded to target machine:
- NMAP
- Netcat


NOTE: Use this payload only against systems that you are authorized to access


Variables:
<PATH>: Local hard drive path to extract resources
 
<LISTEN_IP>: IP address of Netcat listener
 
<LISTEN_PORT>: Port that Netcat is listening on
 
  
Please note that some AV's will flag Netcat as a dangerous file, and may block/quarantine/remove it, rendering this attack useless. Modifications can be made to use a payload of your choice. Do not ask how to use this script. If you can't look at the script and make basic sense of what it's doing, or you don't know how to use Netcat, you're probably too inexperienced to use this vector.
